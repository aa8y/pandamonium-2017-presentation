# Understanding Spark
### by Arun Allamsetty

# Agenda

1. Big Data
2. Spark vs Hadoop
3.

# Big Data

## What comes to mind?
--

- Yet another buzzword, maybe?

--

- Hadoop?

---

# Big Data

## What comes to mind?

- Yet another buzzword, maybe?

- ~~Hadoop?~~ Probably not.

--

- Spark

--

Why?

---

# Let's start with Hadoop
--

### The Good
--

- Distributed computing was hard and expensive.

--

- MapReduce paradigm based on a paper published by Google.

???
Any computation performed by a functional map and reduce can be easily parallelized.
--

- Fault tolerant distributed file system: HDFS

--

- Inexpensive to operate as it could run on commodity hardware.

--

### The bad

--

- Writes data to disk after each operation.

???
This was done to provide a checkpoint feature.
--

- Doesn't support in-memory operations.

--

- While MapReduce is easier, it is no SQL (pun not intended).

---

# What about Spark?

???
Takes all the good things from Hadoop and leaves out the bad.
--

- Supports HDFS (or other Hadoop-supported file systems). For example,

--

  - Amazon S3
--

  - Windows Azure Storage Blobs (WASB).

--

- *Does not* write to disk after each operation.
--

  - Uses RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets) which can recover from failures.
--

  - Is a lot faster than Hadoop.

--

- Supports in-memory operations.

???
Is one of its major selling points.
--

- Written in Scala. Also supports Java and Python.

???
But we will mainly talk about the Scala API.
---

# RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets)

--

- Based on the paper, _Resilient Distributed Datasets: A Fault-Tolerant Abstraction for In-Memory Cluster Computing_ by Matei Zaharia.

???
Berkeley AMPLab alum and co-founder of Databricks which is primary Spark contirbuter.

# Dipping your toes in Canvas Data Lake
### by Arun Allamsetty

---
# What is a Data Lake?

--
#### AWS defines it as

A data lake is an architectural approach that allows you to store massive amounts of data into a central location, so it's readily available to be categorized, processed, analyzed and consumed by diverse groups within an organization.

--
#### So, in simple words

A central repository for all the data in an organization.

* Some shards, mostly the older ones are **multi-tenant**.

--

* Newer shards are almost, always, **single-tenant**.

---
# Canvas Data Lake

--

* Brings the tables from all the shards in one central repository, where they're all queriable, together.

--

* Adds the _Shard ID_ (named `g_shard_id`) to all tables to partition them by their source shards.

--

And a few more nifty things, we'll see later.

* **Serverless** query service which can query data on **S3**.

* Uses the **PrestoDB** query engine as the backend.

* Full plug-n-play capability.

#### It's the best serialization type because it's human-readable.

# YAML columns

### Reasons why YAML is a good choice:

.center[![:scale 40%](images/yaml/black-bear.gif)]

#### It's the best serialization type ~~because it's human-readable~~ for certain situations.

#### Definitely NOT for querying data via SQL.

---
# YAML columns

### _Canvas Data_ to the rescue!

--
#### We deserialize the YAML and make _everything_ queriable.

#### So if you find a certain YAML column which you want to query, ask us :)
